Despite our intellectual capacity and the amount of work we engage in, our minds often devote significant time to contemplating love. We ponder how to attract it and where to find it. Will certain actions lead us to the love of our life? Can a particular encounter help us discover our soulmate?

The desire to be loved is deeply ingrained within us, and our lives can feel lacking without it. It is a well-known fact that humans will go to great lengths in pursuit of happiness. However, this isn't always the case when it comes to love. Love is not something we can simply give or receive to anyone. We are naturally drawn to those who evoke a sense of familiarity, those who remind us of the love we experienced during our formative years.

If we did not receive an ample amount of love during our childhood, we may associate pain with love. As a result, when we encounter someone in our adult lives, we may find ourselves inclined towards suffering. It is because this is the notion of love that has been imprinted in our minds.
