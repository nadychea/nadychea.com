Angkor Wat, the iconic temple complex in Cambodia, is not just a masterpiece of engineering and architecture, but also a symbol of resilience and perseverance. The history of Angkor Wat inspires me to reflect on my own journey in life and how I have overcome challenges to achieve my goals.

Growing up in Cambodia, I witnessed firsthand the aftermath of the Khmer Rouge regime and the toll it took on my country. Despite the hardships, the Cambodian people have shown incredible resilience and strength, rebuilding their lives and their communities.

My personal journey has also been marked by challenges, including financial struggles and personal setbacks. But like the builders of Angkor Wat who overcame obstacles to create something magnificent, I have always believed in the power of resilience and hard work.

It was through coaching that I found my calling to help others unlock their own potential and overcome their own challenges. The coaching journey has been a transformative experience, both for myself and for the clients I work with. It has taught me the value of empathy, trust, and the importance of self-reflection.
